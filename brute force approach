Difficulty Level : Easy
Last Updated : 04 May, 2021
In this article, we will discuss what is Brute Force Algorithm and what are its pros and cons. Below given are some features of the brute force algorithm are:

It is an intuitive, direct, and straightforward technique of problem-solving in which all the possible ways or all the possible solutions to a given problem are enumerated.
Many problems solved in day-to-day life using the brute force strategy, for example exploring all the paths to a nearby market to find the minimum shortest path.
Arranging the books in a rack using all the possibilities to optimize the rack spaces, etc.
In fact, daily life activities use a brute force nature, even though optimal algorithms are also possible.
PROS AND CONS OF BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM:

Pros:

The brute force approach is a guaranteed way to find the correct solution by listing all the possible candidate solutions for the problem.
It is a generic method and not limited to any specific domain of problems.
The brute force method is ideal for solving small and simpler problems.
It is known for its simplicity and can serve as a comparison benchmark.
Cons:

The brute force approach is inefficient. For real-time problems, algorithm analysis often goes above the O(N!) order of growth.
This method relies more on compromising the power of a computer system for solving a problem than on a good algorithm design.
Brute force algorithms are slow.
Brute force algorithms are not constructive or creative compared to algorithms that are constructed using some other design paradigms.
Conclusion:

Brute force algorithm is a technique that guarantees solutions for problems of any domain helps in solving the simpler problems and also provides a solution that can serve as a benchmark for evaluating other design techniques, but takes a lot of run time and inefficient.
